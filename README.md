# Data-Scraping

We will scrape data from an E-Commerce website, using Beautiful Soup.

Beautiful Soup is a Python package for parsing HTML and XML documents. It creates a parse tree for parsed pages that can be used to extract data from HTML, which is useful for web scraping. 

For people who work with data it is important to be able to create own datasets. Often we rely on datasets from someone else. This course should show all data enthusiasts how to scrape and store data in Excel Files.
